# 3d-quickhull
_Header only 3d quickhull in ANSI C_

To use this library, simply include `quickhull.h` once with the `QUICKHULL_IMPLEMENTATION` define in a `.cpp` file.

```c
#define QUICKHULL_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "quickhull.h"
```

The usage of the library is quite simple, generate or gather a set of points, and call `qh_quickhull3d`. The result is a mesh with a set of indexed normals and vertices ready to upload in a GPU.

```c
const int n = 100;
qh_vertex_t vertices[n];

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    float a0 = (rand_0_1() * M_PI * 2);
    float a1 = (rand_0_1() * M_PI * 2);
    vertices[i].z = sin(a0) * radius;
    vertices[i].x = cos(a1) * cos(a0) * rand_0_1();
    vertices[i].y = sin(a1) * cos(a0) * rand_0_1();
}

qh_mesh_t mesh = qh_quickhull3d(vertices, n);

// ...

qh_free_mesh(meshes);

```

If you're interested in low-polygon rendering, generating hundreds of meshes on a randomly generated set of points around a sphere can give such results:
